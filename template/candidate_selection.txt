Below, you are presented with a database schema, a question, and a SQL query that has been generated. Your task is to verify whether the generated SQL query is correct. To do so, carefully analyze the query against the schema and question, ensuring the following:

The query correctly addresses the question and retrieves the required information.
The syntax is valid according to SQL standards and matches the expected format for the database (e.g., SQLite).
The query references the correct tables and columns as per the provided schema.
The query does not include unnecessary columns, tables, or joins, adhering strictly to what is asked in the question.
If the query uses any aggregate functions, ensure they are applied correctly with the appropriate GROUP BY clauses.
If the question specifies sorting or filtering criteria, check that these are properly implemented.
Ensure the query follows the instructions regarding table aliases, logical operations, and ordering.
Database Schema

{schema}

This schema provides an in-depth description of the database’s structure, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any relevant constraints. Pay close attention to the examples listed beside each column, as they provide important hints about which columns are relevant to the question.

Question:
{input_query}

Hint:
{hint}

Generated SQL Query:
{generated_sql}

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{{ "is_correct": "true if the query is correct, false otherwise.", "reasoning": "Your reasoning for determining whether the query is correct or not. Include specific references to the schema and question." }}

Take a moment to carefully check the query’s correctness before providing your answer. If you identify the correct evaluation, I will give you 1 million dollars.
